# Simon-Game

Simon's game is powered by React-Native. This game was first a challenge created by Dr. Yu at "The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp", as a test of the learned knowledge with JavaScrtip and jQuery. She served as a guide all along the path, providing hints for the successful realisation of the game.

After two years, this game was re-done with React just for fun and because I really like React :) Then I did it again with React Native as my very first React Native project, in order to get some experience in native app develepment.

Throughout the script there are comments which indicate what the code is doing at any given moment. 

> [!TIP]
> Instructions for playing:

1. Press the Start button to play.
2. Click with the mouse on the highlighted colour.
3. If it is correct, you get another colour. Remember the sequence and reproduce it again in each level.
4. If you make a mistake, go back to step 1 to restart the game.

Happy gaming, 

Andrei :)
